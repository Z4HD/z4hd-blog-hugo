# Midnight

A modern and configurable theme for Hugo.

Midnight allows site developers to leverage modern technologies on their sites,
including HTTP/2 and CSS Variables. It also strives to stay up-to-date with the
latest Hugo releases, to take advantage of the awesome new features.

It comes with a configurable color scheme for easy styling of your site, along
with plenty of
[other ways](https://bluestnight.com/docs/midnight/users/site/appearance/) to
modify the site's appearance.

It also comes with a plugin system to integrate features not in the theme
without having to modify the theme itself. This allows site developers to
integrate their favorite commenting system, new sidebar widgets, custom fonts,
and to easily load any files necessary to make their own shortcodes work.
